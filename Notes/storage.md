# Storage

流行过的存储设备如下图:

从上往下`per-byte`的价格逐渐降低,不过各种性能参数下降

***Storage Interfaces***

1. `SATA: `*Serial ATA*
2. `SAS: `*Serial Attached SCSI*
3. `NVMe: `*Non-Volatile Memory Express*  (*used with PCIe*)
4. `SAN: `*storage area network*
5. `NAS: `*Network attached storage*
6. `cloud storage`

`IOPS: ` *I/O operations per second*

`MTTF: `*mean time to failure*

***SSD performance is usually expressed in terms of***

1. The number of random block reads per second, with 4-kilobyte blocks being the standard.
2. The data transfer rate for sequential reads and sequential writes.
3. The number of random block writes per second, with 4-kilobyte blocks being the standard.

## RAID

> A variety of disk-organization techniques, collectively called redundant arrays of independent disks (**RAID**),have been proposed to achieve improved performance and reliability.
